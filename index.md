### New paper in Journal of Memory of Language (June 2021)

 Congratulations to [Maria Korochkina](https://mariakna.github.io/) on her first paper! 

Korochkina, M., Bürki, A., & Nickels, L. (2021). Apples and oranges: How does learning context affect novel word learning? Journal of Memory and Language, Volume 120, 104246. (data and script can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/g7ftz/))

Abstract
Despite scarce empirical evidence, introducing new vocabulary in semantic categories has long been standard in second language teaching. We examined the effect of learning context on encoding, immediate recall and integration of new vocabulary into semantic memory by contrasting categorically related (novel names for familiar concepts blocked by semantic category) and unrelated (mixed semantic categories) learning contexts. Two learning sessions were conducted 24 hours apart, with each participant exposed to both contexts. Subsequently, a test phase examined picture naming, translation and picture-word interference tasks. Compared to the unrelated context, the categorically related context resulted in poorer naming accuracy in the learning phase, slower response latencies at the immediate recall tasks and greater semantic interference in the picture-word interference task (picture naming in L1 with semantically related novel word distractors). We develop a theoretical account of word learning that attributes observed differences to episodic rather than semantic memory.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2021.104246

### New Project funded (May 2021)
The DFG approved the second phase of the SFB 1287 "Variability in language" (read more [here](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/pressreleases/detail/2021-05-26-double-success-funding-extension-for-the-dfg-collaborative-research-centers-at-the-unive). 

Our project in the SFB will examine how speakers plan their speech ahead and whether advanced planning depends on available resources (manipulated using a driving simulator).

### New paper accepted in Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (May 2021)
Congratulations to Hyein Jeong for her first paper! The paper, data and script can be accessed [here](https://osf.io/9gy4r/files)
The study uses behavioral, acoustic, and neurophysiological data to examine the impact of word co-occurrences (extracted from big corpora) on language production.

### New Collaborator (01.03.2019)

Emiel van den Hoven joined the lab to work on utterance planning across languages


### New DFG grant (29.11.2018)

A newly funded DFG grant will allow us to study how speakers plan utterances (i.e., how many words they plan ahead before articulation onset, in which order words are encoded within planning units). To do so, the project capitalizes on cross-linguistic differences in how words constrain the pronunciation of one another in an utterance (e.g., to produce the correct form of the determiner in _Die schwarze Katze_ german speakers must have accessed the gender of the noun. English speakers can produce the determiner in _The black cat_ correctly without having accessed the noun.)
Experiments (behavioral, eye-tracking) will be conducted with German, French and English speakers.
